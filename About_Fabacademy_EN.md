Fab Academy is an intensive five-month program that teaches students to envision, design and prototype projects using digital fabrication tools and machines. It is a multi- disciplinary and hands-on learning experience that empowers students all over the world to learn-by-doing and to become active participants in more sustainable futures.

The rapid development of digital fabrication technologies during the last years and its democratization, has been transforming industries, as well as old educational and research paradigms. The Fab Academy, together with the rest of the like 'How to Grow Almost Anything', is an example of a new approach to learning in the digital age.
Our Distributed Educational Model, mixing in-person and online experiences, has been responsible for the creation of a vast community of learners and practitioners in every corner of the planet; this hybrid model takes the best of both worlds (tradicional education and online courses) to make a resilient and adaptable course, ready for facing today's global and local challenges.

This transformative educational experience, focused in bridging both technical and soft skills, have students learn in local workgroups (Fab Labs), with peers, mentors, and machines, which are then connected globally by content sharing and video for interactive classes, forming a gobal network of 250 students in more than 65 Fab Labs.

The course is directed by Neil Gershenfeld from MIT’s Center For Bits and Atoms and based on MIT’s rapid prototyping course: How to Make (Almost) Anything.
